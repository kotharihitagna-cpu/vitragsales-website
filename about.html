      <p style="font-size:16px; margin-bottom:12px;">
        The roots of Vitrag Sales Corporation go back to <strong>1971</strong>, when
        Late Shri <strong>Bhailalbhai Kothari</strong> first entered the metal scrap
        business. Over the years, he built strong relationships with industries and
        traders through his simple, honest and straightforward working style.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:16px; margin-bottom:12px;">
        In <strong>1985</strong>, the next generation joined the business, and the
        family continued to grow its presence in the scrap market. To serve
        customers in a more organised and professional way, 
        <strong>Vitrag Sales Corporation</strong> was formally established in
        <strong>1992</strong> in Surendranagar, Gujarat.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:16px; margin-bottom:12px;">
        Today, Vitrag Sales Corporation acts as a reliable bridge between
        <strong>manufacturers generating scrap</strong> and <strong>industries that
        use scrap as raw material</strong>. We are active across Gujarat and
        support both sides with transparent deals and dependable service.
      </p>

      <p style="font-size:16px; margin-bottom:18px;">
        We believe that scrap business works best when it is simple, clear and fair
        for everyone involved. The following principles guide every transaction:
      </p>

      <ul style="list-style:disc; margin-left:22px; font-size:16px;">
        <li><strong>Honesty in grading &amp; weights</strong> – material is graded
          and weighed fairly so both supplier and buyer can trust the process.</li>
        <li><strong>Long–term relationships</strong> – we prefer steady, repeat
          business over one–time profit.</li>
        <li><strong>Simple, clear communication</strong> – no confusion about
          rates, quality or payment terms.</li>
        <li><strong>Timely payment</strong> – we honour our commitments and ensure
          payments are made as agreed.</li>
        <li><strong>Reliable loading &amp; lifting</strong> – for nearby suppliers
          we support yard clearance and loading so their space remains free.</li>
      </ul>

    <div style="max-width:850px; margin:0 auto;">
      <h2>Partners to Industry – Not Just Traders</h2>
      <p>
        We are not just scrap traders; we see ourselves as <strong>partners to
        industry</strong>. Our role is to make sure that scrap leaves your
        factory smoothly and that the right, graded material reaches your
        furnace or rolling mill at the right time.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top:12px;">
        If you are a manufacturer looking for a trusted buyer for your scrap, or
        a foundry / mill looking for reliable scrap supply, we would be glad to
        connect and explore a long–term association.
